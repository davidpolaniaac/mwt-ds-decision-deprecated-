      "The `__init__` function is simple. It first calls the parent initializer and then sets some options. The options is sets are two things designed to make the programmer's life easier. The first is `AUTO_HAMMING_LOSS`. Remember earlier we said that when the sequence of decision is made, you have to say how bad it was? This says that we want this to be computed automatically by comparing the individual decisions to the oracle decisions, and defining the loss to be the sum of incorrect decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second is `AUTO_CONDITION_FEATURES`. This is a bit subtler. Later in the `_run` function, we will say that the label of the `n`th word depends on the label of the `n-1`th word. In order to get the underlying classifier to *pay attention* to that conditioning, we need to add features. We could do that manually (we'll do this later) or we can ask vw to do it automatically for us. For simplicity, we choose the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `_run` function takes a sentence (list of pos/word pairs) as input. We loop over each word position `n` in the sentence and extract the `pos,word` pair. We then construct a VW example that consists of a single feature (the `word`) in the 'w' namespace. Given that example `ex`, we make a search-based prediction by calling `self.sch.predict(...)`. This is a fairly complicated function that takes a number of arguments. Here, we are calling it with the following:\n",
      "\n",
      " - `examples=ex`: This tells the predictor what features to use.\n",
      " - `my_tag=n+1`: In general, we want to condition the prediction of the `n`th label on the `n-1`th label. In order to do this, we have to give each prediction a \"name\" so that we can refer back to it in the future. This name needs to be an integer `>= 1`. So we'll call the first word `1`, the second word `2`, and so on. It has to be `n+1` and not `n` because of the 1-based requirement.\n",
      " - `oracle=pos`: As mentioned before, on training data, we need to tell the system what the \"true\" (or \"best\") decision is at this point in time. Here, it is the given part of speech label.\n",
      " - `condition=(n,'p')`: This says that this prediction depends on the output of whichever-prediction-was-called-`n`, and that the \"nature\" of that condition is called 'p' (for \"predecessor\" in this case, though this is entirely up to you)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we're ready to train the model. We do this in three steps. First, we initialize a vw object, telling it that we have a `--search` task with 4 labels, second that the specific type of `--search_task` is `hook` (you will always use the `hook` task) and finally that we want it to be quiet and use a larger `ring_size` (you can ignore the `ring_size` for now)."
