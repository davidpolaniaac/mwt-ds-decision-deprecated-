Minimal test just to verify that the output looks reasonable. This is
not a regeression test since numerical output varies between
platforms. Think of this just as a little instant gratification for
building the code.

Running 'make test' or 'make -f Makefile.<flavor>' should produce this
output (modulo one decimal place of accuracy on some of the later
numbers)
