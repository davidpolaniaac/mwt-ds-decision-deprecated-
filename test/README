Test suite for vw:

You may add arbitrary (train/test/varying-options) tests
by adding data (train, test) files and their expected reference
STDOUT and STDERRs

Test to run should be added below the __DATA__ section in RunTests

Tests are separated by an empty line
Each test is represented by a pair or triplet of items
   1st item is the command to run, {VW} represents the vw executable
   2nd item is the expected (reference file) standard output
   3rd item is the expected (reference file) standard error
file-names are relative to this (test) directory

Examples:

__DATA__
# Test 1:
{VW} -d train-sets/0001.dat -f models/0001.model
    train-sets/ref/0001.stdout
    train-sets/ref/0001.stderr

# Test 2:
{VW} -t train-sets/0001.dat -i models/0001.model
    test-sets/ref/0001.stdout
    test-sets/ref/0001.stderr

# Test 3: without -d, training only
{VW} train-sets/0002.dat    -f models/0002.model
    train-sets/ref/0002.stdout
    train-sets/ref/0002.stderr

# Test 4: same, with -d
{VW} -d train-sets/0002.dat    -f models/0002.model
    train-sets/ref/0002.stdout
    train-sets/ref/0002.stderr
