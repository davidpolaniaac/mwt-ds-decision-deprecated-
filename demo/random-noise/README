Demo of vowpal wabbit's ability to separate signal from noise.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
--------------

    You must have the following in your environment to run the demo:
    All the blow components must be present and located somewhere
    in your PATH.

    1) A reasonable Unix-like env, with standard utilities including:
            GNU less
            GNU diff
            bash

    2) The following executable should be in your vw distribution:
            vw
            vw-varinfo

    3) The following are used to do the density and correlation plots
       that the demo uses.

            R
            ggplot2


Main idea of this demo:
-----------------------

As long as noise is random, it cannot bias a predictor.  If it was
biased, and could affect the model we're building - it would't be
called "noise."

    The linear expression used in the demo is:

        y = a + 2b - 5c + 7

    (It is a parameter you can actually pass to the main script to
    change the default).

    Each demo sequence consists of the following steps:

        Generate a random train set in which the label y is a perfect
        linear combination (a + 2b - 5c + 7) of the input features.

        Generate a model from this random train-set.

        Generate a _separate_ train-set using the same linear
        combination formula, but with a different random seed.
        so the two sets are completely different, even though they
        are based on the same formula (and model.)

        Train a model on the train set.

        Test the model on the test-set, while ignoring the existing labels.

        The predicted results should equal the actual test set labels.

The demo has 3 parts:

    1) Ideal conditions.  No noise added.

    2) Global noise in the range [-1, 1] added to the continuous label
       y in the train-set.

    3) Per input feature noise of +/-50% of each variable range
       is added to the train set.

We demonstrate that despite the noise, the (almost) perfect model
is being learned in each of the 3 parts of the demo.

The whole demo is scripted.
