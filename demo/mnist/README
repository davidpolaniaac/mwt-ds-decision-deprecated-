mnist (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is the traditional
set for testing neural network implementations.  mnist8m
(http://leon.bottou.org/papers/loosli-canu-bottou-2006) is a variant of
the original mnist training set augmented with deformations.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

  * make mnist8m.test.confusion
      this will download the mnist test set and the mnist8m training set
      train a (neural network) model on mnist8m, evaluate on the 
      original mnist test set and report a confusion matrix
      results in test errors: 107 out of 10000
        disk requirements: about 2 gigabytes
        training time requirements: about an hour on one core
        memory requirements: less than 256 megabytes
