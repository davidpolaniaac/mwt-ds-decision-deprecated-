This is the vowpal wabbit fast online learning code.  It is Copyright

source license.

Contributing authors are John Langford (Primary), Lihong Li, Alex

Checked into github with clone URL:
git://github.com/gparker/vowpal_wabbit.git

To get the code install git -- in a clean directory:

git clone git://github.com/gparker/vowpal_wabbit.git

I've created a tag for the completely stock initial distribution '2.3'
so to check out that original release and create a branch based on it:

git checkout 2.3
git checkout -b from-2.3

Or, in one command:

git checkout -b from-2.3 2.3
